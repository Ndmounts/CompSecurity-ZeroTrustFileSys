To Do:
Certs
	Cert Verification
	Cert to user parsing (should be verry easy via openssl as the users name is part of the cert DN)
Requests
	creat permissions
	cd perissions
	rm permissions

Network sim
	all of it



Complications and Learnings along the way:
	In trying to come up with solutions to having both certificate authentication and server side file encryption
	we came to the conclusion that handing off the decryption key to the user would pose a security risk if
	the data was in some way stolen from the filesystem. We decided one solution to this would be
	to provide half of the key to the user upon encryption using XOR so that on tha

	Learning how to use the dns of certs for verification



Presentation:
	Demonstrate user addition to the filesystem. With certification key pairs.

	Demonstrate file creation, user reception of portion of encrypted file's hash.

	Demonstrate file read/write capabilities
