AI was used in this project for multiple purposes

Project Idea Forming - Self explanatory used it to help form the project baseline as well as to outline what was possible to do in our time frame

Bugfixing - due to time constraints and several issues in making our code work together we had to use AI to bugfix several portions of the code, 
but the logic behind everything was written and worked separately before combining.

One File (Unused but for testing purposes) - the "picklereader.py" file is a completely AI made file that was made just because I needed to
make sure that the pickle "database" was working correctly.
